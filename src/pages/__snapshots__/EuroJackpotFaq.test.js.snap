Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden are participating in the EuroJackpot lottery, although this list may expand in the future. These countries have a population of 265 million inhabitants, which is more than the EuroMillions which is today offered to over 200 million inhabitants, however this was not always the case. The EuroMillions was initially launched in just three countries:France, Britain, and Spain. Since then, residents from Austria, Belgium, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia and Switzerland have also joined the EuroMillions lottery pool.

                    The EuroMillions and EuroJackpot are actually pretty similar in terms of format:for the EuroMillions, one must choose 5 numbers out of a range of 1 to 50 plus 2 supplementary (Star) numbers between 1 to 12, while the EuroJackpot only has a supplementary number range between 1 to 10. This seemingly tiny difference has a huge impact on the odds of winning however;
                    						the probabilty to win the EuroJackpot is approximately twice as high. The cost for a EuroJackpot ticket is 2 Euros , while the EuroMillions ticket costs 2.50 Euros.

As with all lotteries, the more numbers drawn that match your ticket, the higher your profits. EuroMillions has a minimum jackpot size of 15 million Euros, while the fledgling EuroJackpot offers a still-respectable 10 million Euros starting prize. The EuroMillions really comes into its own with the maximum payout being a massive 190 million Euros while the EuroJackpot caps out at 90 million Euros.

Seven more joined until February 2013. The cooperating countries have pooled together for a maximum payout of 90 million Euros, and a respectable 10 million Euro minimum.

               and EuroMillions are offered in different countries. Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden are participating in the EuroJackpot lottery, although this list may expand in the future. These countries have a population of 265 million inhabitants, which is more than the EuroMillions which is today offered to over 200 million inhabitants, however this was not always the case. The EuroMillions was initially launched in just three countries:France, Britain, and Spain. Since then, residents from Austria, Belgium, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia and Switzerland have also joined the EuroMillions lottery pool.

              <br />
              The EuroMillions and EuroJackpot are actually pretty similar in terms of format:for the EuroMillions, one must choose 5 numbers out of a range of 1 to 50 plus 2 supplementary (Star) numbers between 1 to 12, while the EuroJackpot only has a supplementary number range between 1 to 10. This seemingly tiny difference has a huge impact on the odds of winning however;
              						the probabilty to win the EuroJackpot is approximately twice as high. The cost for a EuroJackpot ticket is 2 Euros , while the EuroMillions ticket costs 2.50 Euros.

               and EuroJackpot offer multi-million Euro jackpots for those lucky enough to pick the right numbers. As with all lotteries, the more numbers drawn that match your ticket, the higher your profits. EuroMillions has a minimum jackpot size of 15 million Euros, while the fledgling EuroJackpot offers a still-respectable 10 million Euros starting prize. The EuroMillions really comes into its own with the maximum payout being a massive 190 million Euros while the EuroJackpot caps out at 90 million Euros. Here are the probabilities of winning compared:
              <br />
               EuroJackpot:1 to 95,000,000 
              <br />

               lottery was launched in 2004 with one draw a week, and has since grown to two weekly draws on Tuesdays and Fridays in Paris. For now, the EuroJackpot has one weekly draw on Fridays, but this may be increased in the future.

               At Lottoland you bet on the outcome of the official draw. For all intents and purposes you will have the exact same customer experience as if you were playing the official lottery. The key difference is that we take your bet and we pay you if you win. We are able to achieve this in two ways. 
              <br />
              
              								
              <br />
               For smaller prize tier payments we make the payment directly from the fund we have from the total ticket sales.

              <br />
               In order for us to make the larger prize tier payments we take out insurance policies to cover the eventuality of a Jackpot win or a substantial payout on the Lotto ticket. Part of the Lotto ticket price you pay goes towards the payment of this policy.

               We are registered with and regulated by the UK Gambling Commission, the Gibraltar Gambling Commission, and the Revenue Commissioners in Ireland. In order for us to retain these licences we have to prove that we are able to make the required payouts to our players should they win and that we have the correct procedures in place to guarantee this.

                         and EuroMillions are offered in different countries. Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden are participating in the EuroJackpot lottery, although this list may expand in the future. These countries have a population of 265 million inhabitants, which is more than the EuroMillions which is today offered to over 200 million inhabitants, however this was not always the case. The EuroMillions was initially launched in just three countries:France, Britain, and Spain. Since then, residents from Austria, Belgium, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia and Switzerland have also joined the EuroMillions lottery pool.

                        The EuroMillions and EuroJackpot are actually pretty similar in terms of format:for the EuroMillions, one must choose 5 numbers out of a range of 1 to 50 plus 2 supplementary (Star) numbers between 1 to 12, while the EuroJackpot only has a supplementary number range between 1 to 10. This seemingly tiny difference has a huge impact on the odds of winning however;
                        						the probabilty to win the EuroJackpot is approximately twice as high. The cost for a EuroJackpot ticket is 2 Euros , while the EuroMillions ticket costs 2.50 Euros.

                         and EuroJackpot offer multi-million Euro jackpots for those lucky enough to pick the right numbers. As with all lotteries, the more numbers drawn that match your ticket, the higher your profits. EuroMillions has a minimum jackpot size of 15 million Euros, while the fledgling EuroJackpot offers a still-respectable 10 million Euros starting prize. The EuroMillions really comes into its own with the maximum payout being a massive 190 million Euros while the EuroJackpot caps out at 90 million Euros.

                         At Lottoland you bet on the outcome of the official draw. For all intents and purposes you will have the exact same customer experience as if you were playing the official lottery. The key difference is that we take your bet and we pay you if you win. We are able to achieve this in two ways.

                         For smaller prize tier payments we make the payment directly from the fund we have from the total ticket sales.

                         In order for us to make the larger prize tier payments we take out insurance policies to cover the eventuality of a Jackpot win or a substantial payout on the Lotto ticket. Part of the Lotto ticket price you pay goes towards the payment of this policy.

                 and EuroMillions are offered in different countries. Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden are participating in the EuroJackpot lottery, although this list may expand in the future. These countries have a population of 265 million inhabitants, which is more than the EuroMillions which is today offered to over 200 million inhabitants, however this was not always the case. The EuroMillions was initially launched in just three countries:France, Britain, and Spain. Since then, residents from Austria, Belgium, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia and Switzerland have also joined the EuroMillions lottery pool.

                <br />
                The EuroMillions and EuroJackpot are actually pretty similar in terms of format:for the EuroMillions, one must choose 5 numbers out of a range of 1 to 50 plus 2 supplementary (Star) numbers between 1 to 12, while the EuroJackpot only has a supplementary number range between 1 to 10. This seemingly tiny difference has a huge impact on the odds of winning however;
                						the probabilty to win the EuroJackpot is approximately twice as high. The cost for a EuroJackpot ticket is 2 Euros , while the EuroMillions ticket costs 2.50 Euros.

                 and EuroJackpot offer multi-million Euro jackpots for those lucky enough to pick the right numbers. As with all lotteries, the more numbers drawn that match your ticket, the higher your profits. EuroMillions has a minimum jackpot size of 15 million Euros, while the fledgling EuroJackpot offers a still-respectable 10 million Euros starting prize. The EuroMillions really comes into its own with the maximum payout being a massive 190 million Euros while the EuroJackpot caps out at 90 million Euros. Here are the probabilities of winning compared:
                <br />
                 EuroJackpot:1 to 95,000,000

                 At Lottoland you bet on the outcome of the official draw. For all intents and purposes you will have the exact same customer experience as if you were playing the official lottery. The key difference is that we take your bet and we pay you if you win. We are able to achieve this in two ways.

                 In order for us to make the larger prize tier payments we take out insurance policies to cover the eventuality of a Jackpot win or a substantial payout on the Lotto ticket. Part of the Lotto ticket price you pay goes towards the payment of this policy.
